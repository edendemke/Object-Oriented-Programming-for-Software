### Southwest Technical College
<p>This repository exists for the purpose of storing any code that I am working on for this particular class. This is significant so that I do not lose any progress that I make on my projects.</p>

<p> I am a young and determined person. I love a good challenge. I enjoy playing video games and camping. I have the best husband in the world, and we currently have one child.</p>
<p> I am taking this program at Southwest Tech because I want to be able to work from home so that I can be the best mom possible while also helping to support my family. We are trying to save up for a house right now, and I want to reach that goal as quickly as possible. I also really enjoy solving puzzles, and that's basically all that coding is when you think about it.</p>
